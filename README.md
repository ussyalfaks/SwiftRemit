[![Soroban Contract CI](https://github.com/Haroldwonder/SwiftRemit/actions/workflows/contract-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Haroldwonder/SwiftRemit/actions/workflows/contract-ci.yml)

Production-ready Soroban smart contract for USDC remittance platform on Stellar blockchain.

## Overview

SwiftRemit is an escrow-based remittance system that enables secure cross-border money transfers using USDC stablecoin. The platform connects senders with registered agents who handle fiat payouts, with the smart contract managing escrow, fee collection, and settlement.

## Features

- **Escrow-Based Transfers**: Secure USDC deposits held in contract until payout confirmation
- **Agent Network**: Registered agents handle fiat distribution off-chain
- **Automated Fee Collection**: Platform fees calculated and accumulated automatically
- **Lifecycle State Management**: Remittances tracked through 4 states (Pending, Processing, Completed, Cancelled) with enforced transitions via a single canonical `RemittanceStatus` enum
- **Authorization Security**: Role-based access control for all operations
- **Event Emission**: Comprehensive event logging for off-chain monitoring
- **Cancellation Support**: Senders can cancel pending remittances with full refund
- **Admin Controls**: Platform fee management and fee withdrawal capabilities
- **Daily Send Limits**: Admin-configurable rolling 24h limits per currency/country
- **Off-Chain Proof Commitments**: Optional proof validation before payout confirmation

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **lib.rs**: Main contract implementation with all public functions
- **types.rs**: Data structures (Remittance, RemittanceStatus)
- **transitions.rs**: State transition validation and enforcement
- **storage.rs**: Persistent and instance storage management
- **errors.rs**: Custom error types for contract operations
- **events.rs**: Event emission functions for monitoring
- **test.rs**: Comprehensive test suite with 15+ test cases
- **test_transitions.rs**: Lifecycle transition tests

### Storage Model

- **Instance Storage**: Admin, USDC token, fee configuration, counters, accumulated fees
- **Persistent Storage**: Individual remittances, agent registrations

### Fee Calculation

Fees are calculated in basis points (bps):
- 250 bps = 2.5%
- 500 bps = 5.0%
- Formula: `fee = amount * fee_bps / 10000`

## Contract Functions

### Administrative Functions

- `initialize(admin, usdc_token, fee_bps)` - One-time contract initialization
- `register_agent(agent)` - Add agent to approved list (admin only)
- `remove_agent(agent)` - Remove agent from approved list (admin only)
- `update_fee(fee_bps)` - Update platform fee percentage (admin only)
- `set_daily_limit(currency, country, limit)` - Configure sender limits by corridor (admin only)
- `withdraw_fees(to)` - Withdraw accumulated platform fees (admin only)
- `withdraw_integrator_fees(integrator, to)` - Withdraw accumulated integrator fees (integrator auth required)

### User Functions

- `create_remittance(sender, agent, amount)` - Create new remittance (sender auth required)
- `start_processing(remittance_id)` - Mark remittance as being processed (agent auth required)
- `confirm_payout(remittance_id, proof)` - Confirm fiat payout with optional commitment proof
- `mark_failed(remittance_id)` - Mark payout as failed with refund (agent auth required)
- `cancel_remittance(remittance_id)` - Cancel pending remittance (sender auth required)

### Query Functions

- `get_remittance(remittance_id)` - Retrieve remittance details
- `get_accumulated_fees()` - Check total platform fees collected
- `is_agent_registered(agent)` - Verify agent registration status
- `get_platform_fee_bps()` - Get current fee percentage
- `get_rate_limit_status(address)` - Read current rate-limit usage for an address
- `get_daily_limit(currency, country)` - Read configured daily send limit for a corridor

## Security Features

1. **Authorization Checks**: All state-changing operations require proper authorization
2. **Status Validation**: Prevents double confirmation and invalid state transitions
3. **Overflow Protection**: Safe math operations with overflow checks
4. **Agent Verification**: Only registered agents can receive payouts
5. **Ownership Validation**: Senders can only cancel their own remittances

## Testing

The contract includes comprehensive tests covering:

- ✅ Initialization and configuration
- ✅ Agent registration and removal
- ✅ Fee updates and validation
- ✅ Remittance creation with proper token transfers
- ✅ Payout confirmation and fee accumulation
- ✅ Cancellation logic and refunds
- ✅ Fee withdrawal by admin
- ✅ Authorization enforcement
- ✅ Error conditions (invalid amounts, unauthorized access, double confirmation)
- ✅ Event emission verification
- ✅ Multiple remittances handling
- ✅ Fee calculation accuracy

Run tests with:
```bash
cargo test
```

## Quick Start

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)

Run the deployment script to build, deploy, and initialize everything automatically:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
# To deploy to a specific network (default: testnet):
./deploy.sh mainnet
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1
# To deploy to a specific network (default: testnet):
.\deploy.ps1 -Network mainnet
```

This will:
- Build and optimize the contract
- Create/fund a `deployer` identity
- Deploy the contract and a mock USDC token
- Initialize the contract
- Save contract IDs to `.env.local`

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to run steps manually:

### 1. Build the Contract

```bash
cd SwiftRemit
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
soroban contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/swiftremit.wasm
```

### 2. Deploy to Testnet

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/swiftremit.optimized.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
```

### 3. Initialize

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  initialize \
  --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> \
  --usdc_token <USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
  --fee_bps 250
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment instructions.

For production readiness assessment, see [PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md).

## Environment Validation

A script checks that every env variable consumed in source code is present in the corresponding `.env.example` file. CI fails automatically if any are missing.

Run locally:

```bash
node scripts/validate-env-examples.js
```

Covers: root `.env.example`, `api/.env.example`, `backend/.env.example`, `frontend/.env.example`.

## Configuration

SwiftRemit uses environment variables for configuration. This allows you to easily configure the system for different environments (local development, testnet, mainnet) without modifying code.

### Quick Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and fill in your configuration:
   ```bash
   # Required for client operations
   SWIFTREMIT_CONTRACT_ID=your_contract_id_here
   USDC_TOKEN_ID=your_usdc_token_id_here
   
   # Optional: customize other settings
   NETWORK=testnet
   DEFAULT_FEE_BPS=250
   ```

3. Your configuration is automatically loaded when running client code or deployment scripts

### Configuration Files

- **`.env`**: Your local environment configuration (gitignored, never commit this)
- **`.env.example`**: Template with all available configuration options
- **`examples/config.js`**: JavaScript configuration module that loads and validates environment variables

### Key Configuration Variables

- `NETWORK`: Network to connect to (`testnet` or `mainnet`)
- `RPC_URL`: Soroban RPC endpoint URL
- `SWIFTREMIT_CONTRACT_ID`: Deployed contract address
- `USDC_TOKEN_ID`: USDC token contract address
- `DEFAULT_FEE_BPS`: Platform fee in basis points (0-10000)
- `INITIAL_FEE_BPS`: Initial fee for contract deployment (0-10000)
- `DEPLOYER_IDENTITY`: Soroban CLI identity for deployment

- **[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md)**: Migration guide for existing developers
- **[PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md](PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md)**: Current production readiness status — what's complete, what's pending, and known risks before mainnet

## State Machine

All remittance lifecycle state is tracked by a single canonical `RemittanceStatus` enum:

```
┌─────────┐
│ Pending │  ← initial state (funds locked in escrow)
└────┬────┘
     │
     ├──────────────────────┐
     │                      │
     ▼                      ▼
┌────────────┐        ┌───────────┐
│ Processing │        │ Cancelled │ (Terminal)
└─────┬──────┘        └───────────┘
      │                      ▲
      ├──────────────────────┤
      │                      │
      ▼                      │
┌───────────┐                │
│ Completed │ (Terminal)     │
└───────────┘                │
```

### Valid Transitions

| From       | To         | Trigger                        |
|------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| Pending    | Processing | Agent calls `confirm_payout`   |
| Pending    | Cancelled  | Sender calls `cancel_remittance` |
| Processing | Completed  | Payout confirmed, USDC released |
| Processing | Cancelled  | Payout failed, funds refunded  |

Terminal states (`Completed`, `Cancelled`) cannot transition further.



1. **Admin Setup**
   - Deploy contract
   - Initialize with admin address, USDC token, and fee percentage
   - Register trusted agents

2. **Create Remittance**
   - Sender approves USDC transfer to contract
   - Sender calls `create_remittance` with agent and amount
   - Contract transfers USDC from sender to escrow
   - Remittance ID returned for tracking (status: Pending)

3. **Agent Payout**
   - Agent calls `start_processing` to signal work has begun (status: Processing)
   - Agent pays out fiat to recipient off-chain
   - Agent calls `confirm_payout` with remittance ID (status: Completed)
   - Contract transfers USDC minus fee to agent
   - Fee added to accumulated platform fees

4. **Alternative Flows**
   - **Early Cancellation**: Sender calls `cancel_remittance` while Pending
   - **Failed Payout**: Agent calls `mark_failed` during Processing (full refund)

5. **Fee Management**
   - Admin monitors accumulated fees
   - Admin calls `withdraw_fees` to collect platform revenue
